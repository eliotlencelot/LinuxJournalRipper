# LinuxJournalRipper
On August 7, 2019 Linux Journal shut its doors for good. The website is partially unprotected but will be also shut down. This is an emergency script make to download old issues of Linux Journal in PDF !

# Dependencies
Any GNU/Linux users might smoothly run this script if (s)he has the following programs :
- lynx
- weasyprint

macOS users must use GNU version of head (ghead).

# Usage
Just run the script in the terminal `./LJ-ripper.sh`
Please run this on a directory with enough free space (3 GB, I think).
Numerous temporary files will be written (> 2700 temporary files).
